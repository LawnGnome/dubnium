At present, Dubnium uses SCons as a build system. Although tremendously
convenient while doing the initial development of the software, it is likely
that a more traditional autoconf-based system will be introduced in the next
couple of revisions for non-Windows users. (I have no idea what I'll do for
Windows users.)

That said, if you are brave enough to try to build it as things stand, here's
what you'll need to do.

Build prerequisites:
- SCons 0.96 or later
- wxWidgets 2.8.0 or later; 2.8.2+ is recommended

If you want to build and run the unit tests, you'll also need CPPUnit 1.12.0.

If building on Windows, you'll need to set the path to wxWidgets (and CPPUnit,
if building the tests) within the SConstruct file in this directory.

Assuming SCons and wxWidgets are installed properly, a release build of Dubnium
can then be built by simply executing "scons" in this directory. After churning
away for a little while, this should result in a "Dubnium" binary in the
build/release/Dubnium directory.

Note that there is no equivalent rule to "make install" at present -- if you
would like Dubnium to be in your $PATH, simply copy the generated binary into
an appropriate directory. I'd recommend /usr/local/bin or $HOME/bin,
personally.
