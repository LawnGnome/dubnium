Version 0.2.0
* Allow server port changes to take effect without restarting.
* Don't build images into the binary itself on sane platforms. (That is,
  everything not called Windows.)
* Investigate watchlist support.
* Perspective load/save code that doesn't crash.


Version 0.2.x
* Bug fixes arising from 0.2.0.


Version 0.3.0
* Allow binding to a given network interface.
* Change fonts in existing SourceTextCtrl instances when changed in the
  options.
* Make the preferences dialog not suck.


Later
* Colour theming support for source code.
* Complete docblock coverage.
* Syntax highlighting for non-PHP languages. I'm quite happy to move this up if
  people write in wanting it, though.
