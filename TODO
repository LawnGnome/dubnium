Version 0.2.0
* Improve property display.
* Only show a certain number of property children in the tooltip.
* Investigate "Run to Here" not removing temporary breakpoints after they're hit.


Version 0.2.x
* Allow server port changes to take effect without restarting.
* Bug fixes arising from 0.2.0.


Version 0.3.0
* Allow binding to a given network interface.
* Change fonts in existing SourceTextCtrl instances when changed in the
  options.
* Make the preferences dialog not suck.
* Perspective load/save code that doesn't crash. (This requires wxAUI events on
  resizes, which may or may not work at the moment. 2.8.10 at least seems to
  not crash.)


Later
* Colour theming support for source code.
* Complete docblock coverage.
* Syntax highlighting for non-PHP languages. I'm quite happy to move this up if
  people write in wanting it, though.
