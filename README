Dubnium is a frontend for the DBGp debugging protocol, which means that it can
be used in conjunction with PHP and XDebug to debug PHP scripts. In the future,
support will also be offered for other DBGp implementations.

The development of this project was sponsored by Google as part of their 2007
Summer of Code, and I'd like to acknowledge the support of both Google and the
project mentor, Derick Rethans.

Please note that this version is undoubtedly of alpha quality, and frankly, if
it weren't for the GSoC deadline, I wouldn't have pushed it out quite yet.
Nevertheless, I hope it may be useful.

Issues can be reported on the issue tracker at the Dubnium home page on Google
Code, which is http://code.google.com/p/dubnium/.
